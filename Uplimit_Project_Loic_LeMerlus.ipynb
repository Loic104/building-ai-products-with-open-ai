      "[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   But Human Rights Watch tied the use of aluminum and automobiles, certain amount of it, to the oppression of the weaker people in China.\n",
      "[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Because as it turns out, about 10% of the global aluminum supply comes from that region, the Xinjiang region in China.\n",
      "[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And what human rights, actually, specifically also pointed to Toyota Volkswagen general motors, Tesla and BYD, the electric vehicle company.\n",

      "[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And this really is about electric vehicles, because aluminum is a component in the batteries, and we're going to need a lot more of it.\n",
      "[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And so we need to kind of nip this in the bud now.\n",

      "[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   >> And it's really interesting.\n",
      "[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   The idea of force, totally, everything that I've said I completely agree with.\n",
      "[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   What's just news wise, interesting and disheartening, is that it was front and center in the American news cycle for good, you know, a number of years.\n",
      "[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And now it's domestic politics have heated up, and we are caught in our own streaming drawing, it has kind of fallen off the radar.\n",
      "[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So good for human rights, one for bringing that back up.\n",
      "[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Yeah, and I would like to point out that a sociator press did reach out to those four companies.\n",
      "[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   They a Tesla and BYD did not get back to them, but general motors, folks who I can tell it did, and said they either will review it, or they've looked into these things before and have not found a connection.\n",
      "[00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   But the point that human rights watch is making is that if you are doing, if you are getting aluminum from Xinjiang, there is literally no way to ensure that.\n",
      "[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   There is no risk of force labor being a part of that.\n",
      "[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So they have to get rid of that source, and that's a tough call.\n",
      "[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   That's a tough thing to ask and something that may, that might have to happen.\n",
      "[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   >> Well, right, I mean, you know, it involves companies making economic decisions against their own interest, which is to say against the profit and bottom line interest.\n",
      "[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And that's tough for companies to do, or tougher than an ought to be, I think, for companies to do.\n",
      "[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   >> Yeah. >> Okay.\n",
      "[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So mine is a little off the beaten path, but as is this story.\n",
      "[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So a number of weeks and or a month ago, I mentioned on a show with Kimberly once, that somehow randomly, I found this woman on Instagram.\n",
      "[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Her name is Cole Brower, and she's a sailor.\n",
      "[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And she's in the middle of something called the Global Solo Challenge, which is racing alone in a sailboat around the world, 27,000 miles.\n",
      "[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And I mentioned it because number one, it's amazing.\n",
      "[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Number two, she's 29.\n",
      "[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Number three, she's like five foot nothing in weighs a hundred pounds.\n",
      "[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   That's her description number.\n",
      "[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And number four, this past week, she sailed around Cape Horn, which is the southern tip of South America.\n",
      "[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Here, I'll go down there, the southern ocean between South America and Archa.\n",
      "[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And it's just, it's a stunning, stunning achievement for anybody, let alone a young person alone.\n",
      "[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And it was really cool.\n",
      "[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And there's a story about her in people magazine, and I encourage you all to follow her on TikTok.\n",
      "[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I think it's Cole Brat, not TikTok Instagram because I haven't got time for two social networks.\n",
      "[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Cole Brower racing is her handle.\n",
      "[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And she's, I mean, the guttiness that this woman has is just so stunning to me.\n",
      "[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And I think it's really cool.\n",
      "[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's really cool.\n",
      "[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It's really cool.\n",
      "[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   What's it like to be out there all along for?\n",
      "[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's a baseball.\n",
      "[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It's crazy.\n",
      "[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I can't imagine.\n",
      "[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   She hasn't seen a human being other than on a screen, which I suppose could be said for some people working in the front of us here on the mainland.\n",
      "[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But you know, we're getting a decent night sleep, and she's on a sailboat that's rocking and things break and throwing across the deck in the middle of the night.\n",
      "[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   She broke a rib and all kinds of stuff.\n",
      "[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Anyway, I encourage you to read it.\n",
      "[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It's cool.\n",
      "[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   It's kind of inspiring.\n",
      "[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I kind of dug it actually.\n",
      "[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It's just really cool.\n",
      "[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   It's just really cool.\n",
      "[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Amazing what human beings can do.\n",
      "[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   But it can't accomplish.\n",
      "[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It's a fact.\n",
      "[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   That is a fact.\n",
      "[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Look at Diana and I add and the story and true.\n",
      "[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And that bending movie that just former,\n",
      "[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Marky plays person for a moment.\n",
      "[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   She's the easiest.\n",
      "[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Indeed.\n",
      "[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And had a show for a bit as well.\n",
      "[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   That's right.\n",
      "[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It wasn't you savvy trailer.\n",
      "[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Back in the day.\n",

      "[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Right.\n",
      "[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Right.\n",

      "[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Yeah.\n",
      "[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   All right.\n",
      "[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Well, that's it for the news, right?\n",
